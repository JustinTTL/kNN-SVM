This introductory notebook contains the evaluation of simple machine learning models on CIFAR10 Dataset. Cross Validation and Vectorized implementations are explored and compared. The relatively poor preformance using these models is indicative of the lacking expressive power of the model and the inability to learn from raw pixel values effectively.
